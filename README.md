# House Price Prediction

This project aims to using the machine learning models such as penalized regression, PLS and Tree-based models (Random Forest, Bagging, Boosting, Bayesian additive regression) to predict the house price

In this project, I performed data preprocessing by cleaning the data, imputing missing values, and transforming categorical features; evaluated the correlation between variables using corplot and used stepwise selection method to choose proper predictors; finally built machine learning models and reduced the RMSE to 0.12 by tuning the parameters.

Sincerly welcome any advice and suggestions!  : )
